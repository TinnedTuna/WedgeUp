WedgeUp 0.1 by Daniel Turner <dsturner@dannyturner.net>

This is a backup script, WedgeUp.

It is designed to backup systems to a series of drives, also known as 'wedges'.
WedgeUp will only moves files it believes to have been changed. That is, if
their checksum (currently, the MD5) has changed, or their timestamp has been
updated.

This is kept across runs of each file.

WedgeUp also supports blacklisting of various directories (and all
subdirectories of that directory). For example, /proc should probably not be
backed up, but /home and /var should be.

WedgeUp stores a copy of it's config file and the file lists (wedgedb) along
with the backups to facilitate recovery.

CONFIGURATION

Sample Config file:

[DEFAULTS]
# Hashes are comments.

# This line tells WedgeUp what disks are available. It tells them a unique name,
# their mount point and their maximum size in bytes. It is a chunk of JSON
disks = {"disk1" : {
              "mountpoint" : "/home/tuna/testdir",
              "size" : "60000" },
         "disk2" : {
              "mountpoint" : "/home/tuna/testdir2",
              "size" : "40000000"}
        }

# This tells WedgeUp to find the master copy of the files list.
dblocation = /home/tuna/NetBeansProjects/WedgeUp/wedgedb

# This is where WedgeUp will start backing up from.
rootdir = /home/tuna/Python

# Stuff you don't want backed up.
blacklist = ["proc","PEN"]

COMMAND LINE ARGUMNENTS

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                        Location of the configuration file, defaults to
                        /etc/wedgeup.conf
  -d DATABASE, --database=DATABASE
                        The location of the database of backed up files.
                        The default is listed in the config file.

BUGS AND OTHER STUFF

Once a drive has been added to the system, not supplying it during a backup
may cause odd behaviour.

All backups are stored to the root of the drive, unless you set the mount point
slightly differently, assuming the drive is mounted at /media/diskmnt:

mountpoint : '/media/diskmnt/path/to/backups'

Do not give any two disks the same name in the disks list. This will cause
bad things to happen. Try to make them memorable to yourself so that you can
find the disks when you want them, or at least use a disk serial number that's
going to be unique and that you can find just by looking at the disk.
